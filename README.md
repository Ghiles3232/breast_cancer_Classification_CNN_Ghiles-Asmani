The notebook covers:

1. **Data Loading**: Using the `sklearn.datasets` to load a breast cancer dataset.
2. **Data Exploration**: It includes steps to convert data into a DataFrame, inspect data structure, check for missing values, and review basic statistics.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Separates features and target labels, and performs a train-test split.
4. **Model Training**: It appears the notebook trains a model (likely a neural network), but further details will confirm the type.
5. **Evaluation**: Includes performance analysis, likely using metrics to assess model accuracy.


# Breast Cancer Classification using CNN

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify breast cancer images. The data is preprocessed and used to train a model that can predict whether a given image is malignant or benign, contributing to early diagnosis and supporting medical research.

## Overview
Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths globally. This project leverages deep learning techniques to classify breast cancer tumors based on image data. By training a CNN on the breast cancer dataset, we aim to achieve high accuracy in distinguishing between malignant and benign cases.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the built-in breast cancer dataset from `sklearn`, which contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The features describe the characteristics of cell nuclei present in the image.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
- TensorFlow and Keras for model building
- Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn for data manipulation and model evaluation
- Matplotlib for data visualization

You can install all necessary dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/breast_cancer_Classification_CNN_Ghiles_Asmani.git
   cd breast_cancer_Classification_CNN_Ghiles_Asmani
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: The notebook includes steps to load the breast cancer dataset and visualize its basic properties.
2. **Preprocessing**: Data is prepared by separating features and labels, and splitting into training and test sets.
3. **Model Training**: Train the CNN model by running:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
4. **Evaluation**: Use the notebook or separate evaluation scripts to test the model's accuracy and view performance metrics.

## Results
The CNN model achieves an accuracy of approximately XX% on the test data. Evaluation metrics and visualizations are included in the notebook for deeper insight into model performance.
